## Deep Learning & Art: Neural Style Transfer

This project is an implementation of a Neural Style Transfer algorithm. Later we generate novel artistic images using the algorithm.

### Problem Statement
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. It merges two images, namely, a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S.

In this project, we would generate an image of the Louvre museum in Paris (content image C), mixed with a painting by Claude Monet, a leader of the impressionist movement (style image S).
